			Notting Hill Tour
		</h1> </header> <p class="editorial-highlights-description body-text-regular">
      The famous blue door in Notting Hill must be one of the most famous British film locations ever to grace the screen. Who could have predicted that?

      The team behind Four Weddings and a Funeral follows up that unexpected smash with another Transatlantic romance as mega-movie star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) falls for mild-mannered English bookseller William Thacker (Hugh Grant).
The title is the setting, though the famously cosmopolitan locale seems to have been ethnically cleansed: this is the whitest Notting Hill you’ll ever see.
During the Fifties, Notting Hill in West London was bedsit-land – cheap, rundown accommodation for immigrants mainly from the West Indies, and became the site of notorious race riots when locals clashed with racist Teddy Boys.
The heart of the film is Notting Hill’s Portobello Road street market, in the top ten of London's tourist attractions – a fact you'll appreciate if you visit at the weekend. But that really is the time to see it. On weekdays, locals buy fruit and veg here. Second-hand goods are included on on Friday but on Saturdays the road is packed for the famous antiques market.
Started in the 1860s, it's been busy ever since, becoming – along with Carnaby Street and the King's Road, Chelsea – one of the centres of the Swinging London phenomenon in the 60s. Sometimes on Portobello it feels like the 60s never went away.

							Notting Hill location: Hugh Grant’s ‘travel bookshop’: Notting Hill, 142 Portobello Road, Notting Hill, London W11

</p> </header> <p class="editorial-highlights-entry-description body-text-regular">
  But there is no ‘Travel Book Company’ on Portobello Road, the down-at-heel shop owned by William Thacker. The store was Nicholls Antique Arcade, then furniture store Gong, it’s now a gift shop/souvenir store, sensibly called – yes – Notting Hill, 142 Portobello Road (and rather cheekily replicating the film’s typeface). Somewhat misleadingly, the shop-owners have added an additional sign reading 'The Travel Book Shop'.
The real Travel Bookshop, on which William’s establishment was based, was around the corner. This really was called The Travel Bookshop, 13-15 Blenheim Crescent, just off Portobello, but rising costs in the area (ironically bumped up by the success of the film) and the continued rise of online selling meant that the shop closed its doors in 2011. The premises has since reopened as a book store once again.

						  Notting Hill location: William Thacker bumps into Anna Scott on the corner: Westbourne Park Road at Portobello Road, Notting Hill, London W11


</p> </header> <p class="editorial-highlights-entry-description body-text-regular">
  Coffee Shop, which stood at 303 Westbourne Park Road, was the little – yes, you guessed it – coffee shop, where William gets the coffee and orange juice at the beginning of the film. It’s since closed down. Next door, on the corner of Westbourne Park and Portobello Road, was the empty property outside which he bumps into Anna Scott. It became – a branch of Coffee Republic, and is now Coffeebello.
A few yards away, across Portobello Road, at 280 Westbourne Park Road is William Thacker's flat. The rundown bedsit interior was a studio set and bore no resemblance whatsoever to what actually lay behind the famous blue door, for this was actually home to the screenwriter Richard Curtis.

  The Coronet Cinema was where William watches Helix, the sci-fi movie short on both horses and hounds, starring Anna Scott. The cinema has closed but the premises has been restored to its original function as a live theatre, oddly named The Print Room, 103 Notting Hill Gate at Hillgate Street, W11.

              Notting Hill location: sneaking into the communal gardens: Rosmead Gardens, Rosmead Road, London W11


</p> </header> <p class="editorial-highlights-entry-description body-text-regular">
						The private communal gardens, into which Anna and William break at night (“Whoops a daisy!”), is Rosmead Gardens, Rosmead Road, W11. The gate has been slightly remodelled since filming (the arch has gone) and the ivy which prevented any glimpse of the gardens from outside has been removed. Don't even think about trying to get in – it's a fiercely private garden, and the drop from the fence is nastier than it appears on film. The bench on which Anna and William sit was simply a prop for the film and doesn't remain.
